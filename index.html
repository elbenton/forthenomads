            <h1>Behind the Scenes</h1>
            <p>For the Nomads is a fundraiser that was started by Frank Fanelli
                as a direct reaction to the devastating effect COVID-19 has had
                on those who rely on live entertainment for a living.
                As a touring musician, tour manager, merchandise seller, and lighting 
                director for more than 14 years, he felt compelled to find a way to help 
                the community that was reeling under the stress of being almost entirely
                out of work.<br><br>
                For the Nomads was born as a necessary reaction to circumstances out of
                anyones control to mitigate the toll it has taken on everyone involved in 
                this industry.<br><br>
